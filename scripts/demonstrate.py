"""
demonstrate.py

Flexible demonstration collection script for recording kinesthetic demonstrations (manually moving the robot arm with
gravity compensation turned on) -- states are logged at a fixed frequency (10 Hz) and then serialized to disk.

To ensure fidelity, all demonstrations are "replayed" deterministically to verify behavior â€“ these replayed
demonstrations are used for training (and optionally, for collecting *visual* states in the future).
