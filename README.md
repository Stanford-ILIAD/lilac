# LILAC

> *LILAC*: Companion Codebase for "No, to the Right â€“ Online Language Corrections for Robotic Manipulation via Shared Autonomy"

Repository containing code and experiments for the LILAC project. Built with
[PyTorch-Lightning](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) for python dependencies and sane quality defaults
(`black`, `isort`, `flake8`, `precommit`).

---

## Contributing

Before committing to the repository, *make sure to set up your dev environment and pre-commit install
(`pre-commit install`)!* Here are the basic contribution guidelines:

+ Install and activate the Conda Environment using the `QUICKSTART` instructions below.

+ On installing new dependencies (via `pip` or `conda`), please make sure to update the `environment-<ID>.yaml` files
via the following command (note that you need to separately create the `environment-cpu.yaml` file by exporting from
your local development environment!):

  `make serialize-env --arch=<cpu | gpu>`

*More detailed instructions for intricate set up (e.g., simulators, experiment tooling, etc.) can be found in
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).*

---

## Quickstart

Clones `lilac` to the working directory, then walks through dependency setup, leveraging the
`environment-<arch>.yaml` files.

### Shared Environment (for Clusters w/ Centralized Conda)

Project-specific conda environments have already been setup for both the Stanford-NLP and ILIAD clusters, under the
name `lilac`. The only necessary steps to take are cloning the repo, activating the appropriate
environment, and running `pre-commit install` to start developing (if you develop on the remote).

### Local Development - Linux w/ GPU & CUDA 11.3

Note: Assumes that `conda` (Miniconda or Anaconda are both fine) is installed and on your path.

Ensure that you're using the appropriate `environment-<gpu | cpu>.yaml` file --> if PyTorch doesn't build properly for
your setup, checking the CUDA Toolkit is usually a good place to start. We have `environment-<gpu>.yaml` files for CUDA
11.3 (and any additional CUDA Toolkit support can be added -- file an issue if necessary).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Stanford-ILIAD/lilac
cd lilac
conda env create -f environments/environment-gpu.yaml  # Choose CUDA Kernel based on Hardware - by default use 11.3!
conda activate lilac
pre-commit install  # Important!
```

### Local Development - CPU (Mac OS & Linux)

Note: Assumes that `conda` (Miniconda or Anaconda are both fine) is installed and on your path. Use the `-cpu`
environment file.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Stanford-ILIAD/lilac
cd lilac
conda env create -f environments/environment-cpu.yaml
conda activate lilac
pre-commit install  # Important!
```

## Usage

This repository comes with sane defaults for `black`, `isort`, and `flake8` for formatting and linting. It additionally
defines a bare-bones Makefile (to be extended for your specific build/run needs) for formatting/checking, and dumping
updated versions of the dependencies (after installing new modules).

Other repository-specific usage notes should go here (e.g., training models, running a saved model, running a
visualization, etc.).

## Repository Structure

High-level overview of repository file-tree (expand on this as you build out your project). This is meant to be brief,
more detailed implementation/architectural notes should go in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

+ `conf` - Hydra structured configurations (`.py`) for various runs (used in lieu of `argparse` or `typed-argument-parser`)
+ `environments` - Serialized conda environments for both CPU and GPU (CUDA 11.3). Other architectures/CUDA toolkit
environments can be added here as necessary.
+ `src/` - Source code - has all utilities for preprocessing, Lightning model definitions, utilities.
    + `preprocessing/` - Preprocessing code (w/ augmentation if necessary).
    + `models/` - Lightning modules.
+ `tests/` - Tests - please unit test (& integration test) your code when possible.
+ `train.py` - Top-level (main) entry point to repository, for training and evaluating models. Define additional
top-level scripts as necessary.
+ `Makefile` - Makefile (by default, supports `conda` serialization, and linting). Expand to your needs.
+ `.flake8` - Flake8 configuration file (Sane Defaults).
+ `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Pre-commit configuration file (Sane Defaults).
+ `pyproject.toml` - Black and isort configuration file (Sane Defaults).
+ `ARCHITECTURE.md` - [WIP] writeup of repository architecture/design choices, how to extend/re-work for different
 applications.
+ `CONTRIBUTING.md` - [WIP] instructions for contributing to the repository, beyond Quickstart above.
+ `README.md` - You are here!
+ `LICENSE` - By default, research code is made available under the GPLv3 License. Change as you see fit, but think
deeply about why!

## Start-Up (from Scratch)

Use these commands if you're starting a repository from scratch (this shouldn't be necessary typically since original
repository gets set up once, but I like to keep this in the README in case things break in the future).

Generally, if you're just trying to run/use this code, look at the Quickstart section above.

### GPU & Cluster Environments (CUDA 11.3)

```bash
conda create --name lilac python=3.8
conda activate lilac
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch
conda install ipython pytorch-lightning -c conda-forge

pip install black flake8 hydra-core isort matplotlib pre-commit wandb

# Install other dependencies via pip below -- conda dependencies should be added above (always conda before pip!)
...
```

### CPU Environments (Usually for Local Development -- Geared for Mac OS & Linux)

Similar to the above, but installs the CPU-only versions of Torch and similar dependencies.

```bash
conda create --name lilac python=3.8
conda activate lilac
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio -c pytorch
conda install ipython pytorch-lightning -c conda-forge

pip install black flake8 hydra-core isort matplotlib pre-commit wandb

# Install other dependencies via pip below -- conda dependencies should be added above (always conda before pip!)
...
```

### Containerized Setup

Support for running `lilac` inside of a Singularity or Docker container is TBD. If this support is
urgently required, please file an issue.
