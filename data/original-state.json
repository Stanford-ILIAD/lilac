// Original-State -- Records original x/y/z positions of the various objects in the scene; each demonstration records
//                   *offsets* (in cm) along each dimension (from each object's center-of-mass). The coordinate frame we
//                   use is relative to the robot/table; (0, 0, 0) is the point on the robot's base touching the table,
//                   with -x meaning to the "left" of the robot base, +y meaning towards the far end of the table, and
//                   +z representing height from table.
//
//                   This file is mostly for convenience/resetting the environment given we share robots with different
//                   students; the model only sees the offsets (learning actual locations implicitly, through data).
